# Weather App

This is a simple weather application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to search for weather information for any city and displays the current temperature, weather description, humidity, wind speed, and the time of day.

## Features
- Search for weather by city.
- Displays current temperature in Celsius.
- Shows weather description (e.g., clear, rainy, etc.).
- Displays the humidity percentage and wind speed.
- Shows the time of day in a human-readable format (e.g., "Monday 14:30").
- Includes weather icon based on the current condition.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** for structure.
- **CSS3** for styling.
- **JavaScript** for functionality.
- **Axios** to fetch weather data from an API.

## How It Works
1. Users enter a city name in the search input field and hit "Search".
2. The app makes an API request to [SheCodes Weather API](https://www.shecodes.io/) for weather data of the requested city.
3. The app displays the weather information, including the temperature, weather description, humidity, wind speed, and the current time.
4. The app uses an icon to represent the current weather condition.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nboyce9/vanilla-weather-search.git
```

2.Navigate to the project folder:

```cd vanilla-weather-search```

3.Setup API Key

To make the app work, you need an API key from SheCodes Weather API.

    Create an account on SheCodes and get your API key.
    Replace the placeholder in the app.js file with your API key:

    let apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"; // Replace with your actual API key
